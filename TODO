This is a list of Features that would be nice to have, but may never actually be developed...

- Import books from folder.
- "Search in all opened files/entire collection" feature (is it possible?).
- Split view (like kdevelop)
- Drag-able tabs (like firefox/chrome)
- auto-import via isbn
- export/import collection:
  * dump database (light export)
  * backup library feature
- nepomuk?
